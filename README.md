# PHP_lightentingTalk
A brief PHP project example.

-PHP originally stood for **Personal Home Page**, but it now stands for the recursive initialism **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor**. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)

Created to streamline building webpages, instead of having to write repetitive code in C.
